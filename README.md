# Carpathian Vampire

By Garry Francis

## Background

Deep in the Carpathian Mountains, the Romanian villagers tell tales of the strigoi. The strigoi are said to be troubled spirits that have risen from the grave. They are attributed with the abilities to transform into an animal, become invisible and to gain vitality from the blood of their victims.

There have been recent reports of peasant children dying mysteriously in the local village. Their bodies had been drained of blood and they had puncture wounds in their necks. The villagers believe that a recently deceased count is responsible. They believe he's a strigoi. In Western culture, we would call him a vampire.

The villagers have hired you to kill the vampire. After a long journey, you have arrived at the former count's castle. A cold shiver runs down your spine. Killing vampires is never easy. Why should this one be any different? But hurry. You don't want to be his next victim!
